/* Converts struct tm to time_t, assuming the data in tm is UTC rather
   than local timezone.

   mktime is similar but assumes struct tm, also known as the
   "broken-down" form of time, is in local time zone.  mktime_frog_utc
   uses mktime to make the conversion understanding that an offset
   will be introduced by the local time assumption.

   mktime_frog_utc then measures the introduced offset by applying
   gmtime to the initial result and applying mktime to the resulting
   "broken-down" form.  The difference between the two mktime results
   is the measured offset which is then subtracted from the initial
   mktime result to yield a calendar time which is the value returned.

   tm_isdst in struct tm is set to 0 to force mktime to introduce a
   consistent offset (the non DST offset) since tm and tm+o might be
   on opposite sides of a DST change.

   Some implementations of mktime return -1 for the nonexistent
   localtime hour at the beginning of DST.  In this event, use
   mktime(tm - 1hr) + 3600.

   Schematically
     mktime(tm)   --> t+o
     gmtime(t+o)  --> tm+o
     mktime(tm+o) --> t+2o
     t+o - (t+2o - t+o) = t

   Note that glibc contains a function of the same purpose named
   `timegm' (reverse of gmtime).  But obviously, it is not universally
   available, and unfortunately it is not straightforwardly
   extractable for use here.  Perhaps configure should detect timegm
   and use it where available.
