LibUsb-Win32 Change Log
V1.14.1.3 (06/12/2010)

  interface to fail when used as a filter driver.
  

PREVIOUS VERSIONS
====================

V1.14.1.0 (06/01/2010)
=======================
* Updated logging functions and standardized log message display format.

* Updated inf-wizard to use the new directory format for the libusb-win32
  binaries.

* Updated package directories to reflect the winddk BUILDARCH env variable.
  (i64 := ia64, x64 := amd64)
  
* Added request to get the current configuration in usb_open().

* Fixed 2960644 (reported by farthen) crash on shutdown with x64 based
  systems while using inf files for each libusb device.

* Added additional log message only included in debug/chk builds.
  
* Updated default log levels to highest verbose level for debug builds.

* Added test signing support to the libusb-win32 make.cmd. This allows
  libusb0.sys and libusb0.dll to be signed with a digital signature.
  (see make.cmd for mmore details)

* Added MSVC 2008 project files

* Moved version defines to an include file (libusb_version.h)
  This file is generated from libusb_version_h.in with "make.cmd makever"

* Removed all "dist" commands from cyg/mingw makefile.  Instead use "make.cmd"
  in the "ddk_make" directory.

* Fixed filter setup not running in 64bit mode

* Fixed 64bit inf-wizard, testlibusb-win builds

* Added set initial config value #1 when the driver is not a filter.
  optionally, the initial configuration value can be specified in the inf
  file: HKR,,"InitialConfigValue",0x00010001,<your config value>

* Added support for querying device registry keys 
 (LIBUSB_IOCTL_GET_CUSTOM_REG_PROPERTY)

* Added support for querying device properties 
 (LIBUSB_IOCTL_GET_DEVICE_PROPERTY)

* Fixed possible race condition in kernel add_device()

* Updated default ddk build version number to 1.1.14.0 to facilitate
  Microsoft WHQL submission.

* Added DDK build distribution system.  Official libusb-win32 releases 
 (after 0.1.12.2) are built using Microsoft's WinDDK.  (see make.cmd)

* Fixed 2658937 (reported by Tim Roberts) The libusb-win32 driver always
  acts as a power policy owner.
